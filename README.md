# Lottery-Addiction
In this project I create the logical core of the lottery addiction app which calculates probabilities to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.

I focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

I also use data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The dataset has info on 3,665 drawings from 1982 to 2018.
